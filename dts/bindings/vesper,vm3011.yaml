    The VM3011 is a Digital MEMS Microphone featuring extremely 
    low power consumption, suitable for voice activation applications
    in battery powered consumer devices.

compatible: "vesper,vm3011"

include: "i2c-device.yaml"

properties:
    data-pin:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        The PDM DATA pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16:

            data-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2:

            data-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

    clk-pin:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        The PDM CLK pin to use.
        Set pin similarly to data-pin.

        The DOUT interrupt GPIO.

    lr-select:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        The LR-select pin on the VM3011 determines the left or right channel
        for stereo applications, where 2 VM3011 devices share the DATA and CLK 
        lines. For mono applications, the LR-select line still needs to be tied 
        to GND or VDD.
        False:
          LR-select = GND --> Left channel --> data set on falling CLK edge
        True:
          LR-select = VDD --> Right channel --> data set on rising CLK edge
